title: what I'm up to now
---

I'm pursuing these, just to list a few (in no particular order):

1. Waiting for the results of my submission, of 
[seven photos](https://alls-futility.tumblr.com/post/614080452947591168/a-series-of-seven-photos-as-yet-untitled-the), 
to [Singapore
International Photography Festival](http://sipf.sg).
2. Getting re-acquainted with the ground, as a way to have fun and delight.
I got a reminder about that, from Vaishali Iyer's [blog-post](https://thestillspace.org/2020/03/22/ode-to-the-ground/).
3. Determining if [a writers' group](https://www.meetup.com/Writers-Collective/) is helpful for me.
4. a pleasure for me: staying in touch with friends. This includes chatting over software like WhatsApp.
5. keeping my time free to do whatever I may become excited about.
