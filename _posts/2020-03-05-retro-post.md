Reading a book by David Ulrich, "Zen camera: creative awakening with a daily practice in photography".

Found words (or the vocabulary) to describe what I spend a significant amount of energy on nowadays: creating the necessary conditions for "the arrival of the muse... - what artists call inspiration and many call the 'aha' moment [...] the creative intelligence occurring when the artist or seeker is open, taking place through the cracks of the ordinary, rational brain". (Page 94).

Here I share a photo (I have) taken on 26th December, around the time of a supposed eclipse. It draws me somehow... I stay open to where it calls me.

As Ulrich says (on Page 88), the famous figure in spirituality, Rumi, has a quote/poem: 

> "Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray "
