title: "Quotes I found on the web-site/blog of an artist"
---

I reproduce a few quotes that I found on the web-site 'Slow Muse:
By Deborah Barlow' ([http://www.slowmuse.com/](http://www.slowmuse.com/)).

> What we need more of is slow art: art that holds time as a vase holds 
> water: art that grows out of modes of perception and making whose 
> skill and doggedness make you think and feel; art that isn’t merely 
> sensational, that doesn’t get its message across in ten seconds, that 
> isn’t falsely iconic, that hooks onto something deep-running in our 
> natures. In a word, art that is the very opposite of mass media.

–- Robert Hughes

> How to live? A life in the world or a world in the head? To be seen 
> and recognized outside, or to hide and think inside? Actor or hermit? 
> Which is it? She wanted both—to be inside and outside, to ponder and 
> to leap.

-- Siri Hustvedt, in the book 'The Blazing World'

> In order to sell art, you had to “create desire,” and “desire,” he said, 
> “cannot be satisfied because then it’s no longer desire.” The thing 
> that is truly wanted must always be missing. “Art dealers have 
> to be magicians of hunger.”

-- Siri Hustvedt, in the book 'The Blazing World'

> Artists are people driven by the tension between the desire to communicate 
> and the desire to hide.

-- the writer and psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott

> For most of life on the planet, being hidden is the default condition... 
> visibility is a luxury. Rarely are earth-colored tones the symbols of
> opulence and royal blood. We are most comfortable being hidden 
> but we yearn to be seen.

-- Jane Hirschfield, in the book 'Hiddenness, Uncertainty, Surprise: Three Generative Energies of Poetry'

> Many friends have asked me when I will start writing on Slow Muse again. I am not sure how to answer that question. Between intention and action there is an indeterminate gap. Whatever it was that inspired my writing here for 12 years is now going through a transmutation of its own. I have had to be in surrender and to patiently wait for the what and the when to manifest.

-- Deborah Barlow, in [the blog-post 'Yet to come'](http://www.slowmuse.com/2018/10/11/yet-to-come/)
