I love reading interviews. Whether it is an interview of Kevin Ma, founder
of the magazine known as Hypebeast, or [an interview of Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/2015-12-ferriss), entrepreneur
who reportedly said No to selling his business for millions of dollars,
I get to find out a bit more about these people.

So, one day, I thought, how about I interview myself? Then others can find
out more about me. [chuckles].

But... what would I ever ask myself?

Thankfully, I found some questions that were addressed to the public, on
the social-network web-site known as LinkedIn, and guess what, I answered them!

And now, I collect my answers to those questions, in this blog-post! Ta-dah!
I have an interview... of myself! (Although others asked those questions).

[clears throat]. Let's start the interview!

**How are you challenging yourself in 2020? - Elisha**

My challenge for myself so far, in 2020, is to balance my time on social media - or, more broadly speaking, my time on an electronic computing device - with my time off the Internet. It would be interesting to see how I can do this in the light of a trend towards webinar(s) and work-from-home, set against a background of virus-news, virus-concerns, virus-fretting, virus-worrying and virus-scares.

**What has been one project or assignment in which you broke the rules and had fun in the creative process? - Joseph**

I once took an undergraduate-course on Composing Music in the Classical Style (for example, in the style of Mozart). For an assignment in that course, I wrote a musical work that appears to be thoroughly twentieth-century, instead of looking eighteenth-century. My course-instructor did not accept my work, but I still had fun. (I’ve realised the importance of surrounding myself with people who value creativity and innovation - which is not everyone, and I certainly don’t really appreciate flattery and/or smooth talk, either).

**Tell me what is your oops-boo-hoo moment this week, and what you learnt from it. - Phing**

An “oops-boo-hoo” of mine, as you call it? I run a blog where I post photos from my trips to art-galleries in Sg. Art-hunting, if you will. But I got a 
little lost; something didn’t feel right (about such blogging) anymore. I 
asked the person known, on LinkedIn.com , as Alin Sneha Abraham, for her perspective on the matter; I said I wasn’t sure if my blogging was adding value to the world. Alin said something to the effect that it is more important that I enjoy myself; that way, at least one person benefits. So my oops-boo-hoo was to overlook my own enjoyment of the activity in question. I concluded that I liked visiting galleries, but posting photos on social media? Not so much.
