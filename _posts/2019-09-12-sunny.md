title: 'A few print-making techniques, and possibly goodbye'
layout: post

Recently, at an Open House at [STPI](https://www.stpi.com.sg/), I learnt - 
or rather, watched, if not tried my hand at it myself, in some stage of the 
respective process - the print-making techniques/processes of Intaglio, Linocut and
Relief-printing.

By the way, owing to various circumstances, this may or may not be my final
post on this blog.
