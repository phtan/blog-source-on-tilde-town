title: "where to buy postcards in Singapore"
---

I joined Postcrossing last month, and I've since been keeping a look-out 
for places that sell postcards, on this tiny island in South-east Asia. 

I list a few below. Do you know of others? I hope you and I can add to 
each other's knowledge! :slight_smile:

### the usual suspects: souvenir shops

- somewhere in Kampong Glam (near Sultan Mosque) 
- somewhere in 
Chinatown 
- Raffles Hotel 
- National Museum of Singapore 
- the shop 
called Arch, in the shopping mall called Capitol, near City Hall MRT 
Station

### on the art-sy side
- National Gallery of Singapore 
- a pop-up bazaar called Invade, in 
Esplanade Theatres 
- Objectifs Centre for Film and Photography 
- this 
photographer, [Christine 
Nagel](https://www.christinesartventures.com/and-more), has been 
shooting various sights in Singapore, and sells her own photos as 
postcards.

### unexpected postcards
- the (alcoholic beverages) bar called No. 5 Emerald Hill provides postcards, and mails them out to international addresses, free of charge. You can buy a drink if you feel paiseh. (Information accurate as of late 2019).
