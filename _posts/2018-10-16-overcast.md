title: "choice of espresso"
---

If there were a situation in which I had to spend money on an espresso,
and I had SGD$6 - which could only be spent on espresso -  and a choice of
 espresso from any coffee-shop
in Singapore, I would go to
 [La Ristrettos](https://www.facebook.com/LaRistrettos/) 
and get theirs, which is sold at $3. 

When I was there once, a member of the  staff told me
he had served me espresso that was single-origin (probably he was referring
to the coffee beans - which, on that day, he might have said was from 
Ethiopia).

The other $3? If I could, I would go back there another day to spend it.

Reviews of that coffee-shop can be found
