title: 'Eateries in Singapore that are not "chains", as far as I am aware'

The title of this post seems self-explanatory to me. The list below
includes eateries that have branches overseas but not in Singapore.

This post was inspired by a question that a member of the Meetup-group
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/returnedsingaporeans/">
'Returned Overseas Singaporeans in Singapore (R.O.S.S.)'
</a>
has asked. That member said that she found herself eating at the same places, 
implying that she wanted a change of eateries, hence her question, which
was somewhat similar to the title of this post.

I list:

0. Morton's Steakhouse
0. Slow Bakes (which is supposedly under the same umbrella-organisation
as the chain of meat-free restaurants, 'Real Food')
0. La Ristrettos
0. Brunches Cafe
1. Tong Fong Fatt Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice
0. Mahota Commune
0. Il Den
0. Kemono Healthy Japanese Roast Chicken (it seems delivery-only)
1. Tolido's Espresso Nook
0. MTR Restaurant
0. Podi & Poriyal
0. Hj Maimunah
