It didn't seem fun to have to meet the requirements 
(of 
[Singapore International Photography Festival](http://sipf.sg/)
 2020) to have 
seven photos in my submission. So, 
[on Tumblr](https://alls-futility.tumblr.com/post/611746367108448256/creative-commons-attribution-40-international), 
I present five photos that I do have, instead; they were taken in the past two years (all on the island of Singapore ); I hope you enjoy them.
