title: '~cel and SecureScuttleButt (SSB)'
---

My fellow townie [~cel](http://tilde.town/~cel), 
whom [~vilmibm](https://twitter.com/nate_smith)
has organised [a fund-raiser](https://www.gofundme.com/pitch-in-for-a-townie)
 for - that was 
about eight months ago - has now seemed to jump onto the proverbial
bandwagon of Scuttlebutt. I had that impression after visiting the
web-page 
[https://git-ssb.celehner.com/@f/6sQ6d2CMxRUhLpspgGIulDxDCwYD7DzFzPNr7u5AU=.ed25519](https://git-ssb.celehner.com/@f/6sQ6d2CMxRUhLpspgGIulDxDCwYD7DzFzPNr7u5AU=.ed25519)

I had to do a little reading to get a better idea of what he was up to, though.

Perhaps the following reading material may help a new-comer to Scuttlebutt:
