title: "Places, in Singapore, where I have had wine for about SGD$10"
---

From what I remember, a can of beer, bought from a convenience store, costs
more in Singapore than in Taipei, the capital-city of Taiwan, so maybe
the price of a glass of wine is more expensive in Singapore than in Taipei, too,
if not elsewhere.

Having said that, I have somewhat frequented the following establishments,
during so-called 'happy hours'; the price comes up to SGD$10 to SGD$11 for a 
glass, at the most. I list the price of a glass of wine, whether it be red or white:

0. [Bruno's Bistrot/Pizzaria & Grill](https://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/bruno-s-pizzeria-grill/). $7.50, exclusive of a 'service charge' of 10%. All operation-hours are 'happy hour', I've heard. A plus maybe: bottles of wine are stored openly (that is, visibly) in a chiller for that purpose. *544 Serangoon Road, Singapore 218166*
0. [Hej Kitchen & Bar](https://www.hejthere.com). 'Happy hours': 12 PM to 7 PM - it's not clear to me whether these are for weekdays, weekends, or both.  $8, exclusive of service charge (10%) and GST (7%). *â€‹180 Orchard Road, Singapore 238846*. ![Signboard that displays the prices of alcoholic beverages during 'happy hours' at the bar Hej](https://i.imgur.com/OAGjcoN.jpg "Happy hours at the bar Hej")
0. [The Boiler (at the structure Esplanade)](https://www.theboiler.com.sg/contact-us). 'Happy hours': 5.30 PM to 8.30 PM, daily maybe. $8.50, exclusive of Service Charge and GST. *8 Raffles Ave, #01-13A, Esplanade Mall, Singapore 039802.* ![Information on so-called 'Happy Hour' at a restaurant called The Boiler](https://i.imgur.com/m9a3hYn.jpg "Information on Happy Hours at the restaurant The Boiler")
0. [Steakout](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d2538704-Reviews-Steakout-Singapore.html). 'Happy hours': Sunday to Thursday, excluding public holidays and their eves. $2 off the regular price of wine - this works out to be approximately $10. *89 Victoria Street, #01-01, Victoria Hotel, Singapore 188017*. ![A sign-board upon which the prices of various alcoholic beverages are written, pertaining to so-called 'Happy Hours' at the restaurant Steakout](https://i.imgur.com/27VXANQ.jpg "Information on 'Happy Hours' at the restaurant Steakout")
