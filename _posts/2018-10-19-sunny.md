title: "choice of hot chocolate"
---

If I had to spend money on hot chocolate, and I had SGD$20 to do so - and if
 the money can only be used
on hot chocolate - and if I had access to any seller of hot chocolate
 in Singapore, I would go to
 [Laurent Bernard Chocolatier](https://www.facebook.com/Laurentbernardchocolatier/). 

(Hot chocolate, there, starts at $10 approximately.)

Its brick-and-mortar address is as follows:

> 80 Mohamed Sultan Road, #01-11, Singapore 239013

And the telephone-number:

> +65 6235 9007

And of course it is thanks to my god that I had the luxury to imbibe the
hot chocolate there.

Even making this post is a luxury my god affords me. So grateful.
