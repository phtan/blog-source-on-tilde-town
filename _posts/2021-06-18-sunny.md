title: "A story of two wolves"
---

I saw this story on the Internet.

A village elder told a young child: 
"There are two wolves in every person. One is loving and gentle, while 
the other is hateful and brutal. They fight with each other all day and 
all night." 

The child asked: "Which wolf wins?"

The elder replied: "The one you feed the most."
