Just to share, I've recently heard of at least two artists who make their works accessible to the public without involving a gallery or a dealer.

1. William Powhida invites the public to be his Friend; the perks of being such a Friend include free (as in gratis) ownership of his artwork, if you have taken care of it (at your place) for five years.

2. Tsuyumi Miwa is having an exhibition at Maduro Jazz Club, Singapore ( http://www.maduro.sg/ ) . Tsuyumi says her paintings will be on sale, at a lower price than usual, because there is no "gallery commission fee".

- Time: 6.30 PM onwards , on 24th April
- Price of a ticket: SGD$25 
- Tsuyumi is contactable at her web-site, 
( http://www.heymiwa.com/ )

What's in the price of a ticket? Her friend, the composer-singer-actor James Flynn ( http://www.flynnjazz.com/ ) has composed songs that interpret Tsuyumi's paintings , which he is scheduled to perform, with his trio, on the evening of Tsuyumi's exhibition.
