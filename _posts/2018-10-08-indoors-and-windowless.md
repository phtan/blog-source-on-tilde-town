title: 'A room-mate leaves'
---

One of my room-mates - who has just moved in, in the past two weeks or so - 
said he is leaving tomorrow to reside at his new work-place, a 'vegetable farm'.

Yes, he said he would be staying on the farm.

And he says that 'in the beginning', he would have no pay/salary. Perhaps he
would have food and accommodation.

When I asked him for the name of the place, he said it is called 'Onesimus Garden',
which he claims is in the area of Lim Chu Kang (probably in the north-west region
of the island of Singapore).
