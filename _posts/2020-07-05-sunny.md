Not much time on my hands (to make this post).

- Started a journal that I'm publishing on Github, intentionally challenging
my audience, if any, to be familiar with Git and Github-like websites.

- Experienced, and still experiencing, challenges with connecting to tilde.town.
Firewalls and what-not. VPN doesn't seem to be an option (yet).

Gotta go.
