By no design of my own, both last year (2018 A.D.) and this (2019 A.D.)
, I've made purchases 
that are somewhat associated with Indonesia - and specifically, batik -
 approximately
at the time of the respective year's Chinese New Year.

Last year, it was a button-down shirt from Kiah's Gallery 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kiahb4tik/">
(https://www.facebook.com/Kiahb4tik/)
</a> - where the seller told me, "Batik is a dying art." (she also effectively
said, if I'm not mistaken, something like, "The batik-shirt 
chooses its owner.") - 
and this year, a coin-pouch, from The Green Collective SG
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegreencollectivesg">
(https://www.facebook.com/thegreencollectivesg) 
</a> - maybe the designer, or maker, of the coin-pouch is from Indonesia.

Now, what do I say about Indonesia? Or about batik?

I just thank my god that I have the luxury of the experience of buying batik,
while on the island of Singapore.
