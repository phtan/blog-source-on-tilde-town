A certain Homeless Kodo has said, "we only say something is good when
it goes our way", or something to that effect. I quote,

> Sooner or later everyone starts thinking of nothing besides themselves. You say, “That was good!” But what was good? It was only good for you personally, that’s all.

Be that as it may, I take pleasure and interest in the different ways I can say
something is good, whether it is good for me, or for someone else, or whatever.

So, I make the following list, based on words currently in my vocabulary:

0. excellent
0. nice
0. super
0. amazing
0. awesome
0. great
0. perfect
0. 棒(a Chinese word)
0. _baik_ (a word in Bahasa Indonesia and Bahasa Melayu, pronouced like baa-eggk)
0. _pona_ (a word in the constructed language Toki Pona, which has no native speakers)
0. pleasant
0. 赞(a word that seemed to have been used in Taiwan in the modern past 
(about 1.5 decades ago?); maybe it isn't used 
so much nowadays anymore?)
0. miraculous
0. fabulous
0. nice - oops, I mentioned "nice" already.
0. fun - I seldom use this word, but I've heard others use them within my ear-shot
0. majestic - usually I use this word to describe God and God's works

That's it. I've heard a Spanish version of "miraculous" and "fabulous" before, but 
because I seldom use those Spanish words, I omit it from my above list.
