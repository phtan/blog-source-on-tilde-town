Yesterday, I caught a set by the DJ 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/itchirology/">
Itch
</a>
, at 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/kultkafe/">
Kult Kaf√©
</a>
, Singapore. I heard songs 
with lyrics that sounded like they were in the language Mandarin Chinese,
those with Japanese-like lyrics, and (at least) one that Itch said was from Indonesia,
when I asked him where that song was from.

Maybe he - and the other DJs who spun - was playing vinyls yesterday.
