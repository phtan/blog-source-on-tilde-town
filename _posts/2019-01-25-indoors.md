title: "Singaporean artists I 'know'"
layout: post
---

I've met a Teo Eng Seng (Mister) recently - yesterday afternoon - and when 
he asked me, "how many Singaporean artists do you know", with 'Singaporean'
defined as 'working in Singapore', I realised I was stumped for an answer
beyond a handful of names (not much more than a couple of them); more names
came to me after the moment of interrogation had passed. Well, for the benefit
of whoever's interested, I make a table below, in response to Mr. Teo Eng Seng's
question.
