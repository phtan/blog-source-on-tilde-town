title: "Places where I have used my laptop"
---

I have had the luxury and privilege of using my laptop at 
the following places, where beverages are sold

(I am currently residing in Singapore - which is in South-east Asia, if you
are not familiar with her.)

1. 'Brunches'. URL: [https://www.facebook.com/BrunchesCafe/](https://www.facebook.com/BrunchesCafe/)
1. 'Enchanted'. Have charged my laptop at the power-sockets there. URL: [https://www.facebook.com/EnchantedCafeSg/](https://www.facebook.com/EnchantedCafeSg/)
1. 'Old Hen'. Have charged my laptop there. URL: [https://www.facebook.com/oldhencoffee/](https://www.facebook.com/oldhencoffee/)
1. 'Coffeesmith'. [https://www.facebook.com/CoffeesmithSG/](https://www.facebook.com/CoffeesmithSG/)

1. 'Real Food', in the shopping mall Orchard Central. [https://www.realfoodgrocer.com/](https://www.realfoodgrocer.com/)

I had the inspiration to post about this after visiting [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/)'s
record of cafes that she has visited: [https://taniarascia.github.io/coffee/](https://taniarascia.github.io/coffee/)  

And of course I can only have such inspiration if [my god](http://phtan.github.io/religion.html)
 gives it to me.
I thank Him for that.

2. 'Symmetry'. [http://www.symmetry.com.sg/](http://www.symmetry.com.sg/)

I have not used the power-sockets, at the above two places, to charge my
laptop, if indeed there are power-sockets available.
