title: "Charlie's suggestions for music"
---

Charlie was a visitor whom I met in Singapore (in the past couple of weeks
or so). He's from Melbourne and he
wore boots from the brand Blundstone. He was born in the year 1996 A.D.

He suggested that I listen to the following musicians:

1. [Skip skip ben ben](https://skipskipbenben.bandcamp.com/)
1. [Boyz & Girl](https://tenzenmen.bandcamp.com/album/boyz-girl)
3. [Snail 
Mail](https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/snail-mail-announces-southeast-asia-tour-singapore-jakarta-bangkok-more-confirmed)
4. [La Luz](https://www.facebook.com/laluzusa)
