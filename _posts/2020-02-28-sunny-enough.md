I feel rewarded for getting up earlier than usual today - 
[Helena Wasserman Eriksson](https://www.hnworth.com/article/truths/life/why-i-started-stage-6-a-conscious-co-living-space/)
 's talk was scheduled for 8.30 AM.

[Her talk](https://creativemornings.com/talks/helena-wasserman-eriksson-on-invest), 
on the topic "Invest", began with questions for the audience. Then: "I want you to think how you have invested in yourself, and the great feeling you had when you did that. Then take 5 minutes to share it with your neighbour."

If I think about it now, attending her talk was an investment in myself, too. And I think this investment has paid off already - at the talk's venue, I met people, who not only seemed to share similar interests with me, but also seem to be better than myself at it. For example,

- [Eugene Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugeneseancheng/) has done photography at weddings, something I haven't done (yet), but it's something which Eugene asserts will provide lots of opportunities to develop photographic skills
- Tsuyumi Miwa 's name-cards feature her paintings on the reverse side - an idea I can consider if I do start making name-cards for my artistic practice. (Tsuyumi-san's website: http://heymiwa.com/ )
- I met someone who talked about one's posture, in relation to pain in one's knees, while running. Now I am thinking about whether my posture, while I use my laptop, is the best for my body.

Lots of food for thought, to say the least!
