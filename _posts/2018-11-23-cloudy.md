title: 'description of a certain kind of coffee in Singapore'

A certain kind of coffee in Singapore has been described as 'too bitter and
too sweet at the same time', if I am not mistaken in my recollection.

> "When we tail ministers or members of parliaments in their tours of 
the orderly housing estates, I buy them [the camera crew] little plastic bags of milky tea 
or coffee. These brews are always too sweet and too bitter at the same 
time..." - Joanne Leow, 2016.

Coffee, when bought in Singapore, is not necessarily in the style of an
Americano, espresso, Long Black and the like. In my experience, the ones that
cost SGD$0.70 to $1.50 tend to not be espresso-like or even latte-like - the latter
cost, maybe, upwards of SGD$3.

This might be an alert to seekers of coffee who are new in Singapore.
