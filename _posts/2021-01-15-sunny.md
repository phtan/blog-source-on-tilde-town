I got an account on the social network called Mastodon because I wanted to say
the following to the admin of the Mastodon-server/instance where 
[~abraxas](http://tilde.town/~abraxas/)
 had ~abraxas's account:

"since ~abraxas is dead, can you reflect that on his Mastodon-account?"

Mastodon allows accounts to become "In Memoriam". Kinda like a grave-stone.

I thought it would be easier to reach that admin through Mastodon than
the internal mail-system of [tilde.town](http://tilde.town)

You can find me on Mastodon, at [https://im-in.space/@rogbeer](https://im-in.space/@rogbeer)

Till next time.
