title: "want to eat somewhere cheap in Orchard Road?"
---

I list a couple of places where the prices of (cooked) food are cheaper
compared to the rest of the eateries that can be found in the area known
as Orchard Road (of Singapore).

1. In the lower floors of the shopping mall Lucky Plaza.
3. Somewhere near the building Midpoint Orchard, on the side of the road opposite
the shopping mall Orchard Central. One level down from street level.

By 'cheap' I mean that one perhaps could get something to eat for SGD$3.
