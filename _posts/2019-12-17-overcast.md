title: "Recipe for a (Milo-based) cocktail"
---

I got this recipe from a bartender at [Bar Stories](https://www.facebook.com/pg/barstories.sg/)
, located on the island of 
Singapore.

It is based on Milo,  a non-alcoholic beverage which is kinda based on malt.
(I am aware, from anecdotal evidence, that Milo is popular, if not well-known,
 in at least the South-east Asian countries of Malaysia and Singapore).

I didn't manage to get the name for this cocktail. Nonetheless, the ingredients:

0.  Egg white x 1 
2. Milo, as in the drink, not the powder x 2 oz 
3. Butter-scotch, the liqueur x 0.25 oz 
4. Dark-chocolate liqueur x 0.5 oz 
5. Dark-chocolate bitters x 3 dashes
6. Black Cow vodka (for a creamy taste) x 1.5 oz
