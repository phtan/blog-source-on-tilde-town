Somewhat belatedly, on the occasion of Women's Day - it is refreshing for me to encounter, in literature, a wife saving her husband in distress (instead of the other way round).

I'm referring to Beethoven's only completed opera, "Fidelio".

Fidelio is the alias of a character named Leonore, who gets employed by the jailer, Rocco - and even cross-dresses as a man - so that she can gain access to the inner-most section of the jail; she wants to see if her husband, Florestan, is indeed imprisoned there.

I think I've revealed enough about the plot, so I'll stop relating the details here.

Let me end with the (German) words from the finale of the opera:
 
> "Nie wird es zu hoch besungen, Retterin des Gatten sein." (Never can we over-praise a wife who saves her husband.) Translator: Lionel Salter.

Details for lovers of classical music: I listened to a 1995 recording, featuring Nikolaus Harnoncourt as conductor, and Chamber Orchestra of Europe.

I believe well-deserved honour goes to National Library Board (of Singapore)
for stocking both CD and CD-player at the public library known as 
Library@Esplanade .
