title: "What's with the name, ~rogbeer?"
---

[Mr. Rogbeer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetan-rogbeer-03a65b68/) 
was my colleague in 
[a organisation](https://smart.mit.edu/about-smart/about-smart) where 
I worked on a couple of
projects that involved programming.

It was around that time that I registered myself on [tilde.town](http://tilde.town),
and I was stumped for a username; I looked up from my laptop and saw his name-tag
on display near his desk; I thought that was an interesting name.

No, I did not get his permission to snatch his surname (on tilde.town).

### Bobs and pieces

* Mr. Rogbeer says he is from Mauritius
* As of 8th October 2018, I have only met two people who said they were from
Mauritius
* The language Creole is spoken in Mauritius, so I'm told.
* The other person from Mauritius (that is, not Mr. Rogbeer) looked like
she was from East Asia. If I am not mistaken, she told me that Mauritians don't
have any one look; there are a variety of ethnicities in Mauritius: she belongs
to a minority there.
